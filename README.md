## Description
This is the landing page I created for COSC52's Short Assignment 1. The webpage builds on the skeleton code in the assignment and adds some content, styling, and a little bit of animation (because every little bit counts 💥) to create a personalized landing page. The website is found at [sofiasb.me](http://sofiasb.me)
